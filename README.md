Database updater: detect all changes in a801's database and pull them

## Performance
**Memory usage** depends on the similarity in both tables; if the rows are in the same order (or just a few are misplaced), it will be minimal, but if they aren't similar at all, it can get really big if the databases are big. Python uses nearly **20MB** and when we ran this updater, **it didn't go over that threshold.**

**Speed** depends on CPU speed and bandwidth. In our setup, we have an Intel Core Processor **(2.4GHz, 1 core) and 250Mbit/s** for bandwidth, and it checks **27000 rows per second** (transferring the whole database, with about **100 million users in about 1 hour**)

## How it works
This updater acts as a middle-man between both databases (external & internal) and its purpose is to replicate the external (a801) one. Keeping in mind that their database is HUGE (near 100mil users), this replication process has to be very quick.

The first idea that came to my mind was a big `SELECT` query on their database and then many small `INSERT` ones in ours (and that is partly what we still do!), however, it takes nearly 5-6 hours to do just that, so I thought of this smarter approach:

First, we optimize our database for reads (the MyISAM database engine does a good job, but there are better ones), and we also store CRC32 hashes (4 bytes) for each row: just concatenate every column in every row into a string and then call apply this hash on them.

Second, we send a query to the external database requesting only row ID and this CRC32 hash. We then compare them with our hashes, and if they match that means the row hasn't been modified, so we just ignore that row.

Third, from the rows that do not match their hash, we fetch the rest of the data from the external database and store that, with the new hash in our DB.

This means that the first time it runs it takes nearly 5-6 hours because it doesn't have anything to compare, so it has to read and write A LOT of data, but from the second run it takes nearly 1 hour. That's a 5x speed improvement!
I'm also pretty sure that if we used PyPy or a language like C++ or Rust, this would get way faster.

## How to use
You need to have access to atelier801's API database and a database with their structure and a few extra tables.
Once you got that, you can clone this repository and use `docker build`, and when you're gonna run the container, set the proper environment variables (`A801_IP`, `A801_USER`, `A801_PASS`, `CFM_IP`, `CFM_USER`, `CFM_PASS`) and you're good to go!
